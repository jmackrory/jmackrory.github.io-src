## About Me

I'm Jonathan Mackrory.
I've studied physics and earned a Ph.D. from the University of Oregon.
My graduate work is discussed a little [here](physics.md).
I'm transitioning into data science in the hope that maybe my work will be a little more applied, 
a little more flexible, and maybe even useful to someone.
