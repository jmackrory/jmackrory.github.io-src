# US Electricity Project

This series explores some data on the US Electrical grid using data from www.eia.gov.
The [first](ELEC_explore) part of the project is just an very partial exploratory analysis of
the bulk electrical data set, focusing on state level attributes from 2003 till the present.

The [second](EBA_explore) and [third](EBA_RNN) parts dig more into the real-time data and does some time-series
analysis with some weather data.  The weather data was gathered from NOAA's automated
system, and right now focuses on the airports in the three biggest cities in each city. 

For simplicity the initial models focus on Portland International Airport and 
Portland Gas and Electric's demand.
The third part then builds some neural networks to try and improve over the simple classical
techniques.
