# jmackrory.github.io-src

Source for my personal Github website.
This relies on Pelican for converting IPython Notebooks and Markdown
to html.
Note that the output directory is a submodule of this repo
giving the html for "jmackrory.github.io"

The webpage was created following this guide: https://fedoramagazine.org/make-github-pages-blog-with-pelican/
for initial setup.
I'm using the "pure" pelican-theme from https://github.com/PurePelicanTheme.
This currently also relies on the Pelican plugin for Jupyter notebooks
available here: https://github.com/danielfrg/pelican-ipynb.

The overall plan will be to convert my nearly finished data science projects into
articles by writing up and cleaning up the notebooks.
